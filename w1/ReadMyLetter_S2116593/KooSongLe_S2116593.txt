My name is Koo Song Le with matrix number, A1234567. I am majoring in Software Engineering. This is my second time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling anxious about taking this subject.  I acquired 3.7 for my previous Fundamentals of Programming course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get 4.0 for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will study hard. Wish me luck!!!
